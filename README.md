  Day 1 : Introduction to FabLab
  
  The course is conducted by the FabLab section of MESCE and was commenced on 2nd August 2017 Wednesday. The course is lead by Mr. Muhammed Jaseel, an ambitious man , who descriptively explained about the scopes of FabLab, CNC, and 3D Printing. By the end, simple assignments were given to the students.
  
  Daily Assignments:
  - Create an account in Thingiverse
  - Create an account in Instructables
  - Create an acoount in GrabCAD
  - Create an account in Youtube
  - Create a GitHub Page
  
  All assignments were completed on time.

  Day 2: GitHub Pages and Documentation and Introduction to 3D Printing
  
  The second day of the course was about getting along with GitHub and detailed page developement process. After the session, the class was split into two groups, after which we learnt in detail about 3D Printing. Both the mechanical and designing sides of 3D Printing was explained in detail by the supporting staff. 
  
  Daily Assignments:
  - Develope a desccriptive page in GitHub
  - Upload the daily progress on the class
  - Install Cura Software
  - Install any of the mentioned creative designing softwares: Autodesk AutoCAD/SketchUp/Rhinoceros 3D/Catia/CorelDraw/Eagle/SolidWorks
  
  All assignments were completed on time. Among the designing software list, Autodesk AutoCAD and Rhinoceros 3D were chosen for installation.

  Day 3: 3D Printing and Desinging Basics
  
  On the third day, we learnt the basics about designing in Rhinoceros 3D and conversion of the design file to .stl format to print using the 3D printer. A brief explaination about the 3D printing was also given. After the session about the basics, the students were asked to design a simple 1cm x 1cm x 1cm block to be printed using the Ultimaker 2+ 3D Printer.
  
  Daily Assignments:
  - Project: Ideate the design of any daily use product to be built using the 3D printer or any CNC machine
  
  All assignments were completed on time. THe basic prototype designed and printed can be viewed [here](https://ameenkb.github.io/Images/Basic Prototype 1.jpg).
